<h2>Gradebook: Overview</h2>


<h3>What it is</h3>

<p>The Gradebook is a tool for instructors to calculate, store, and
distribute grade information to students online.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Features:</strong> Using the Gradebook, instructors may:</p>

<ul><li>Autocalculate course grades

<br /><br />
</li><li>Create and edit a mapping of the course letter grade to a 100% scale
<br /><br />
</li><li>Add, view, edit, and release point values of assignments and/or
assessments to students
<br /><br />
</li><li>Manually enter, view, edit, and release to students their scores
and grades
<br /><br />
</li><li>Transmit scores to the Gradebook from tools such as Tests &amp; Quizzes, thereby creating a corresponding assignment in the Gradebook and recording student scores for that assignment.

<br /><br />

</li><li>Export scores and grades to Microsoft Excel (in <code>.xls</code>
or <code>.csv</code> format)
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Viewing scores:</strong> The Gradebook will allow students to
view their own scores and grades, once instructors have released them.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Instructors can view information in the Gradebook in different
ways, including a general overview for each course, assignment detail,
course grade detail, student roster, adding or editing assignments,
and gradebook options.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Students can view their assignment scores, cumulative score, course grades and calculated assignment grades, once an instructor releases them; students can sort their assignments by title, due
date, grade, and total possible points per assignment.
