<h2>Using Gradebook to view and export your student roster</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<h4>Viewing your roster</h4>

<p>To view your student roster from the Gradebook, follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">course site</a>,
click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the Gradebook, click the <strong><code>Roster</code></strong> link.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You will see a list of students whom you are authorized to grade,
their scores on all graded assignments, and their cumulative
scores. You can search for a particular student by name or ID. If your
course has defined sections or groups whose members you are authorized
to grade, you will be able to filter the roster to display those
sections or groups one at a time. If your course does not yet have any
students enrolled, you will see the message, "No students
to display".

<p>To view the roster by section
or group, next to "View", select the section or group.</p>

</li><li>When you are finished viewing your roster, click the
<strong><code>Overview</code></strong> link to return to the main Gradebook menu.
</li></ol>

<h4>Exporting your roster</h4>

<p>To export your student roster from the Gradebook to your computer,
follow these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the menubar of the relevant course site, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the Gradebook, click the <strong><code>Roster</code></strong> link.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To export your roster to Microsoft Excel (<code>.xls</code>) or
<code>.csv</code> format, click the <strong><code>Export for Excel</code></strong> or the
<strong><code>Export CSV</code></strong> button (located near the bottom of the roster).

<br /><br />
</li><li>The default filename format for your exported roster is
<code>gradebook_[courseID]_assignment_name_date.*</code>. The exported
fields and the names of the Excel column headers are "Student Name",
"Student ID", and "[assignment name]". The full student display names
and complete assignment names are exported. Assignment point values
will only export up to two decimal places. Scores are listed in the
assignment name column.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All available class data is exported. If you
sort or filter your roster by your student names before exporting, it
will not affect the output.</p>
