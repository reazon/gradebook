<h2>Uploading/Importing scores to the Gradebook
in bSpace</h2>

<p>In the Gradebook, both students and instructors can view current
scores.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this document,
you need to be assigned a role that has the necessary permissions.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see the Permissions and Roles section of Help.</p>


<p>From within the Gradebook, you can upload CSV files containing columns of scores and then import these as 
assignments. To upload and import scores to the Gradebook, in the relevant course site, click Gradebook 
from the toolbar, and then follow the appropriate steps below.
</p>

<h2>Upload Course Grades</h2>
<p>Note: This section assumes that you have a <b>.csv</b> formatted file of scores stored on your local computer. The first <b>column</b> of your .csv file must contain individual's usernames (e.g.
 student id numbers) The first <b>row</b> of your .csv must contain headings for the columns. </p> 

<p>At the top of the Gradebook, click <b> Upload/Import</b>. Under the list of assignments, click the <b>Upload spreadsheet (csv format) to loading dock </b>link. You will then see a file selection form for uploading a .csv file to the Gradebook loading dock.  For the <b>Title</b>, you must enter a unique name, which will be the name for the uploaded data file once it is in the loading dock.  For the Choose a File option, you may either type in a filename or use the Browse button to browse for and select the file you want to upload. [If you browse and select the file, the full filename will appear in the Title box automatically.] Then click the <b>save</b> button, and upload of the file begins. The Verify Upload screen appears with a preview display of the file contents, allowing you to confirm that correct file was chosen. If you are satisfied with the match between his labels and the data, click the Ok button. If you not satisfied, click the Back button.</p>
<p>Once a file is uploaded to the loading dock, its score contents become available to you for importing as new Gradebook assignments, using the <b>Import</b> link. Uploaded files can also be deleted from the loading dock, using the <b>Delete</b> link. </p>
<p>To import an uploaded file's score contents as a new Gradebook assignment from the loading dock, click the <b>Import</b> link for that file. You will see the Import Preview screen showing the file contents with radio button selectors next to the title of score column. Use the radio button to select the score column to import. [Score columns can only be imported one at a time.] Click the <b>Import Selected</b> button.</p>
