<h2>Importing scores into Gradebook</h2>
 


<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To import grades, you must first create a <code>.csv</code>
spreadsheet file containing columns of point-based scores, and then
upload it to the Gradebook Loading Dock. The first row of your
spreadsheet must contain headings for the columns it contains. The
first column must contain individuals' usernames.</p>

<p>Once you have your <code>.csv</code> file ready for upload, follow
these steps:</p>

<h4>Uploading a file to the Loading Dock</h4>

<ol><li>In your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Near the top, click <strong><code>Upload/Import</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Upload/Import screen, click <strong><code>Upload spreadsheet (csv
format) to Loading Dock</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To select a file for upload, click <strong><code>Browse</code></strong>. Find the file
on your computer, click its name, and then click <strong><code>Open</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the field next to "Title", type a unique name to be displayed
in the Loading Dock.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Verify Upload screen, review the number of assignments and
students for your upload, and view a display of the file's
contents. If the content is correct, click <strong><code>Ok</code></strong>. If you need to
select another file, click <strong><code>Back</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p>Once a file is uploaded to the Loading Dock, its contents become
available to import as new Gradebook assignments. To import an
uploaded file's contents as a new Gradebook assignment, follow these
steps:</p>

<h4>Importing a file from the Loading Dock</h4>

<ol><li>On the Upload/Import screen, find your newly uploaded file in the
Loading Dock, and next to it, click <strong><code>Import</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Import Preview screen, click the radio button to select the
column that represents the assignment and corresponding scores you
want to import. (You can select only one at a time.) Then click
<strong><code>Import Selected</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Import Assignment and Scores screen, enter the following
information:<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>Title:</strong> The title you provided in the steps above
is automatically filled in. If you didn't provide a title earlier, you
must provide one here. The maximum length is 255 characters.
</li><li><strong>Assignment Point Value:</strong> Enter a total point value
for the assignment. This must be greater than zero. Decimal values are
permitted to two decimal places.
</li><li><strong>Due Date:</strong> In <code>mm/dd/yy</code> format,
indicate the assignment's due date, or click the calendar icon to
select a date using the pop-up calendar tool. This is not a required
field.
</li><li><strong>Select a column to import comments:</strong> If a column
in your file contains comments, use the drop-down list to select the
appropriate column, and add the comments to the import. Comments will
appear next to the grades in the Gradebook. This is not a required
field.
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>To include this assignment when calculating the final grade, check
the appropriate box. You can change this option later, if
necessary.<br /><br />
</li><li>To make this assignment's scores available to students, place a
checkmark in the box next to <strong><code>Release assignment</code></strong>. You can
change this option later, if necessary.<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're finished, click <strong><code>Submit</code></strong>. You'll return to the
Import Preview screen, where you'll see confirmation that the
assignment has been added. You can now select another assignment for
import, or click the <strong><code>Reset</code></strong> button to return to the Gradebook
Overview screen. You should see your imported assignment(s) listed
under "Assignments".
